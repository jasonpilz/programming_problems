# BST second largest element

## Problem

Write a method to find the 2nd largest element in a binary search tree.

Here is a sample binary tree node class:
```ruby
class node
  attr_accessor :value, :left, :right

  def initialize(value)
    @value = value
    @right = nil
    @left  = nil
  end
end
```
